# moonshot-synth
A repository for the Stanford Moonshot portable synthesizer project!

ModulinWorking is the file for the main controller (a Leonardo or Teensy in my build)
RedDisplayCode.ino is the file for the Arduino Metro Mini controlling the 8x8 multiplexing display (E40M project).
- You should be able to add any new 8x8 matrix design, give it a 3-digit code, and call for its display from the main board
  in (modulinWorkging.ino)
